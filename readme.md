# Model Evaluation

Accuracy - the number of correct predictions made by the model divided by the total number of predictions. 80/100 = .8.  Accuracy is useful when target classes are well balanced.

Recall - Ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset
TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalseNegatives)

Precision - Ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points.   
TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalsePositives)

F1 score - a combination of Recall and Precision
