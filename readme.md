# Model Evaluation

Accuracy - the number of correct predictions made by the model divided by the total number of predictions. 80/100 = .8.  Accuracy is useful when target classes are well balanced.

Recall - Ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset
TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalseNegatives)

Precision - Ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points.   
TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalsePositives)

F1 score - a combination of Recall and Precision

# Regression

Regression is a task when a model attempts to predict continuous values.  For example, attempting to predict the price of a house given its features is a regression task

Attempting to predict the country a house is in given its features would be a classification task

In statistics, regression toward (or to) the mean is the phenomenon that arises if a random variable is extreme on its first or first few measurements but closer to the mean or average on further measurements
